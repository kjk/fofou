Overview.
=========

For more info: http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/fofou/

Fofou (Forums For You) is a simple forum software inspired by
Joel On Software forum software (http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel).

It's mostly a port of FruitShow PHP forum (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fruitshow).

There are two versions:

* one for Google App Engine (directory appengine). I used this versions for a
  few years but no longer use it and no longer work on it

* second written in Go (directory go), which I currently use at http://forums.fofou.org

Where can I see it in action?
=============================

Forums for my Sumatra PDF viewer are powered by Fofou:

Installation.
=============

For Google App Engine version you need to get App Engine
account and upload fofou (see
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/uploading.html for
details).

Once installed, you can create one or more forums through web interface.

Go version needs to be compiled and run on a server. I use Linux (Ubuntu).
It is, however, not easy to deploy and I'm too lazy to document deployment
process.

Design philosophy.
==================

You'll quickly see that Fofou differs in many ways from most common forum
software. There are good reasons for the differences and Joel Spolsky describes
those reason in great detail:

License.
========

The python/Go code is written completely by me and is in Public Domain.

Html/css/js files are mostly lifted from FuitShow, so they fall under
FruitShow's BSD license.

Contributing.
=============

Fofou is open-source so if you want to improve the code, contribute more skins
etc., fork http://github.com/kjk/fofou/tree/master, make your changes and let me
know. If the changes are good, I'll pull them into my repo.
